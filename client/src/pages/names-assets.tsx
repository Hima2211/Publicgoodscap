// - Large, bold hero section with a gradient or color background
// - Prominent search bar with rounded corners and shadow
// - Grid of name cards with status (Available/Taken), icons, and call-to-action
// - Modern, clean, and playful color palette (blues, whites, gradients)
// - Responsive layout with generous padding and spacing
// - Subtle animations or hover effects on cards and buttons
